# Hi guys!
## My name is Fay 👼🏻
#### Now, I am a sophomore student of software engineering at KMITL. I knew about the code at grade 12 which is the reason that make me decided to join in this faculty for more understanding about coding.

#### I am the beginner about coding but I will try to use this platform to share my code with your guys. So, if you have any suggestion or see some bug in my code, feel free to tell me. I appreciate a lot that you spend your time to read my code.

#### Sincerely thank you all of you 🥺🙏🏻
